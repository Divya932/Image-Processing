##1. How many layers are there in CNN?

A convolutional neural network is a sequence of layers and every layer transforms one volume of activations to another 
through a differentiable function.
Mainly 3 types of layers are stacked to build CNN architecture: Convolution, Pooling and Fully-Connected layer.
Convolutions mainly include kernel multiplications with image matrix to extract out features. Lower level convolutions extract
low level features like edges, gradients, color, etc., while the added layers adapt to higher level features as well.

Pooling is used to scale down images to make it easy to deal with them. 

##2. MaxPooling
##3. 1x1 Convolutions
##4. 3x3 Convolutions
##5. Receptive Field
##6. SoftMax
##7. Learning Rate
##8. Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?
##9. Batch Normalization
##10. Image Normalization
##11. Position of MaxPooling
##12. Concept of Transition Layers
##13. Position of Transition Layer
##14. DropOut
##15. When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting
##16. The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction,
##17. The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction,
##18. When do we stop convolutions and go ahead with a larger kernel or some other alternative (which we have not yet covered)
##19. How do we know our network is not going well, comparatively, very early
##20. Batch Size, and effects of batch size
etc (you can add more if we missed it here)
